1. The dataset is a balanced dataset since the number of binary labels present in the 
the dataset is almost the same.

2. There are no categorical variables so there won't be any cardinality issues and any rare label problem

3. The data doesn't contain any missing values 

4. There aren't any outliers present in the dataset

5. Since the variable magnitude of data is between 0 to 2 there wasn't any need of doing any feature selection 
but for better results, the data should be standardized and it should be on the same scale least 
the minimum values should be 0 and maximum should be between 1.

6. The dataset doesn't contain a large amount of data so here I have proceeded with the 4 machine learning 
algorithms which are logistic regression, K nearest neighbor, decision tree, and support vector machine

7. I have excluded some algorithms like naive Bayes, and ensemble learning as naive Bayes are mostly 
used for text data, and for ensemble learning, we need a large amount of data to train the data.

8. The accuracy for the K Nearest Neighbor and Support Vector Machine is almost the same but there are 
some differences in the precision, recall, and F1 score. But if you see if the precision of the KNN algorithm is
high then the recall of SVM is high so we can't come to a conclusion like this. Henceforth if we see there is
a slight increase in the f1 score of SVM as compared to the KNN.
