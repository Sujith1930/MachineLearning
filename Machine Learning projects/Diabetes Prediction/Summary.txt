The main aim of this project is to use the accuracy of various machine learning and deep learning algorithms to determine whether or not an individual has diabetes.
To equate various classification algorithms to deep learning algorithms to determine the best algorithms for predicting the outcome. 
These projects aim to predict whether or not an individual has diabetes before any tests are carried out
The accuracies of the algorithm are
 Logistic Regression:- 86%
 K Nearest Neighbor:- 84%
 Naive Bayes:-82%
 Support Vector Machines:-84%
 Decision Tree:-90%
 Random Forest:-86%
 Artificial Neural Network:-83%
 As a result of the accuracy, Decision Tree provides accurate predictions that are simple to execute.
